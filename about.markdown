I am a Security Researcher at [Hunt & Hackett](https://huntandhackett.com/) specializing in Windows internals. I do system programming (C for sharing code; Delphi for personal projects), fluently speak [Native API](https://github.com/processhacker/phnt) (from user mode; there is no need to go into the kernel!), and reverse engineer definitions for interacting with various Windows components. Occasionally, even [document](https://ntdoc.m417z.com/) them.
