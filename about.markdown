Hi, there! I am an ICT student and a part-time security researcher who likes Windows internals and system programming. I play a lot with [**Native API**](https://github.com/processhacker/phnt) (from the user-mode side), reverse definitions for undocumented Windows mechanisms, invent AV/EDR evasion techniques, and otherwise have fun with security-related topics.
