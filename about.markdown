Hi, I'm Denis, also known as diversenok. I am an ICT student, and I love researching internals of Windows systems. I apply this knowledge by writing user-mode tools that expose the powerful capabilities of **Native API**. The topics of the most interest for me include everything related to security mechanisms: Mandatory Access Control, AppContainters, security boundaries, and so on.
